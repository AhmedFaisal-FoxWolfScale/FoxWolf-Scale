# FoxWolf-Scale
The FoxWolf Scale is a revolutionary framework for measuring Social Engineering skills based on natural fox and wolf behavior. It gives cybersecurity pros insight into their tactical flexibility (fox traits) and strategic planning (wolf traits). The Gray Wolf Model is the optimal "Golden Ratio" for excellence: 60% fox traits and 40% wolf traits.
